# RTG4 Development Kit Mi-V Sample Designs

Sample Mi-V Libero SoC projects for the RTG4 Development Kit.

This repository contains Tcl scripts that build sample Libero SoC designs for the MiV_RV32IMA_L1_AHB and MiV_RV32IMA_L1_AXI soft core RISC-V processors. Arguments can be passed to the Tcl script to select which variant of the sample design is built.

FlashPro Express projects for each of the designs are available for both variants of the Mi-V cores.

# Libero Projects
The Libero_Projects folder contains the TCL scripts that build the sample Mi-V projects.

## Design Features
The FPGA designs include the following features:
* A MIV_RV32IMA_L1_AHB or MIV_RV32IMA_L1_AXI soft RISC-V processor.
* RISC-V debug block allowing on-target debug using SoftConsole.
* The operating frequency of the design is 50MHz.
* Target memory is LSRAM.
* User peripherals (GPIO, Timers, UART).

## FPExpress
The FlashPro_Express_Projects folder contains the pre-built designs that
can be downloaded directly to the target board using FPExpress.

# Software
The following software is required.

## Libero SoC v12.3
Libero SoC is Microsemi's FPGA design suite that is used to generate the sample projects.
It is available from [here](https://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/design-software/libero-soc#downloads).

## FlashPro Express (FPExpress)
FPExpress is Microsemi's Programming and debug tool. It is included in the Libero SoC V12.3 software and is also
available as a standalone application found [here](http://www.microsemi.com/products/fpga-soc/design-resources/programming/flashpro#software). Please note, that if Libero SoC V12.3 is already on your system, you do not need
the standalone version.

## SoftConsole
SoftConsole is Microsemiâ€™s free software development environment facilitating the rapid development of bare-metal and RTOS based C/C++ software for Microsemi CPU and SoC based FPGAs. It provides development and debug support for all Microsemi SoC FPGAs and 32-bit soft IP CPUs. SoftConsole can be downloaded [here](https://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/design-tools/4879-softconsole).  

### SoftConsole Projects
A set of RISC-V example software projects are also available for these designs from the SoftConsole [page](https://github.com/RISCV-on-Microsemi-FPGA/SoftConsole).
